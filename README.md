# Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC)

## Overview
The Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC) is a C-based application designed to perform arithmetic operations on integers of arbitrary length, overcoming the limitations of built-in data types.

This project implements big-number arithmetic using linked lists, making it suitable for systems programming and embedded applications.
